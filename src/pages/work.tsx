        <Card title="jay - compiler project" to={gh("jay")}>
          CPSC 411, University of Calgary Compiler Design term project. Designed
          and developed a compiler for J-- (subset of Java). Compiler produces
          WebAssembly code, that can be potentially run in the browser.
          Initially was written using Bison, Flex &amp; C++, currently working
          on rewriting the compiler entirely in Rust.

          A group project for CPSC 471, Databases class at University of
          Calgary. This project helped to explore possibilities of SQLite on
          Android and strengthened my SQL knowledge. The app allows you to track
          your fitness needs - from workouts to nutrition.
